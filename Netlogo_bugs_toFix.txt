1) Loading and Unloading unit are not machines
2) Loading and Unloading unit do not have a processing time (reasonable to have one for platooning control purposes)
3) VehicleDestinationEntity does not have a state for "going to unloading station", which is required for battery scheduling
4) How to change the VehicleDestinationNode to consider which recharging station is the choosen one for AGV recharging? More in general, what is the VehicleDestinationNode parameter?
5) Is there a saturation in the speed prompted to AGVs? If not, it should be added


PS. Find a "termination" condition (i.e. something to end the program and store the performance index)
