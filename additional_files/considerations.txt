1) How the attribute "batterycharge" works? Does it go from 0 % to 100%? Or does it go from 0 to 21/42/63 based on the battery capacity of vehicles? It would be better if any vehicle will have the same battery discharging (i.e. from 0 to 100%), but with different time (a factor dependent on the number of batteries)
2) How much battery is needed, on average, for a product? (20-30%?)
